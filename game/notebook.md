Success! This untouched room is exactly what you've been looking for - the scene of the crime!

Your careful detective work has paid off. The empty state of this room matches 
witness accounts - no one was around when the crime occurred. This must be 
where the murderer carried out their plan!

Make sure to document this discovery in your notebook.md file along with your 
other findings about the weapon and suspect.%               

Location of the crime is still unknown - the room must have been empty when it happened...
